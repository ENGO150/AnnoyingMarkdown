AnnoyingMarkdown
================

This project takes args and separates each character by '||'...

Some text => ||S||||o||||m||||e|||| ||||t||||e||||x||||t||

You can build this project by yourself or you can download .zip file with compiled files here: 
https://github.com/ENGO150/AnnoyingMarkdown/actions (select the most recent run)

Project is especially for creating annoying messages on discord, but can be used as regular markdown text.
Thanks for support.
