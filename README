AnnoyingMarkdown
================

This project takes args and separates each character by '||'...

Some text => ||S||||o||||m||||e|||| ||||t||||e||||x||||t||

  
If you want to use (latest) stable version:
- Download AUR package 'annoyingmarkdown-git' (CURRENTLY NOT WORKING)

- Download .zip file with compiled files here:
  https://github.com/ENGO150/AnnoyingMarkdown/releases/latest
  
--------------------

If you want to use latest version:
- Build this project by yourself by running 'build' script (and optionally install by 'install.sh')


Enter text you want to use as args: ./AnnoyingMarkdown Some text

Project is especially for creating annoying messages on discord, but can be used as regular markdown text.
Thanks for support.
